## Abstract

The members of the Araneoidea superfamily account for approximately one-quarter of the entire spider tree of life, with high web diversity and extraordinary silk properties, but their molecular evolution is poorly understood. Here, we first reconstructed the phylogeny of Araneoidea spiders and used it to explore the evolution of silk glands by transcriptome age index (TAI) analysis. Our results revealed an interesting phenomenon in which the major ampulla (Ma) and aggregate (Ag) glands of Araneoidea spiders have younger transcriptomes than other silk glands due to the active expression of young genes that have arisen since Araneoidea differentiation in these two glands. Both the relative TAI and expression analyses also confirmed the active role of young genes. Further coexpression and function analyses showed that some young genes were recruited to the spidroin interaction network to enhance silk properties. The enhanced silk properties allow Araneoidea spiders to arm their foraging webs for more efficient prey capture. Overall, our study highlights that the evolution of foraging webs in Araneoidea spiders may be associated with the active expression of young genes and interaction with spidroins in the Ma and Ag glands.
